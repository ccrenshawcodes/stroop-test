This is my first time taking on a project like this!

Here are my goals.

1. Create a functioning stroop test.
- with a stopwatch,
- display color words (eg red, green, yellow) in
- pre-defined color values
- the user should be able to type in a text box.
- On "enter", the displayed word & its color should change
- and the text box should clear. 

- at the end of the test, display how many words they entered

2. Create a control.
- With a stopwatch,
- display color words in the page's default color 
- The user should be able to type the word in a text box.
- On "enter", the word should change
- And the text box should clear.

3. Add a reset button to both pages. 

Betterment ideas:
- make it so you can only hit 'start' once 
(right now the timer just gets weird)
- validate for user inputs that match color words?
- Automatic focus on the text box on gobtn click
