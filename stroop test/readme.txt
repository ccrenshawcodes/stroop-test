Here are my goals.

1. Create a functioning stroop test.
- with a stopwatch,
- display color words (eg red, green, yellow) in
- random RGB values (?)
- the user should be able to type the matching word in a text box.
- On "enter", the word should change
- and the text box should clear. 

- At the end of the test, display their time
- and score? (if so we would have to not do random RGB values, but values with matches)

2. Create a control.
- With a stopwatch,
- display color words in
- colored text that matches the word
- The user should be able to type the word in a text box.
- On "enter", the word should change
- And the text box should clear.

3. Add a reset button to both pages.
